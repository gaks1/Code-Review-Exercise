          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
          technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
          client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10]
          It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
          supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
          interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
          Document
          Object Model (DOM).
        </p>

        <p>
          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
          facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and
          a
          variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

          Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
          are distinct and differ greatly in design.

        <h2>Example: Compute Quotient and Remainder</h2>
        <code>
          public class QuotientRemainder {
  
            public static void main(String[] args) {
          
              int dividend = 25, divisor = 4;
          
              int quotient = dividend / divisor;
              int remainder = dividend % divisor;
          
              System.out.println("Quotient = " + quotient);
              System.out.println("Remainder = " + remainder);
            }
          }
        </code>

        <code>
          25 / 4 // results 6.5
          // convert 6.5 to integer
          // output will be 6
        </code>

          The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a
          variety
          of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's
          Internet Information Services,[40][41] but they were small niches.[42] Server-side usage eventually started to
          grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.[42]
        </p>

        <p>
          Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications
          with
          behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting
          PDF
          documents[43] and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.[44]
        </p>

        JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.[45][46][47]

          JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch
          statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function
          scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C,
          JavaScript
          makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon
          insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.[48]

          <li>The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because
            the
            addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator</li>
          <li>The binary - operator always casts both operands to a number</li>

          Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var,[69] let[70] or const[71] keywords. Variables
          defined
          without keywords will be defined at the global scope.
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>
            // Declares a function-scoped variable named `x`, and implicitly assigns the
            // special value `undefined` to it. Variables without value are automatically
            // set to undefined.
            var x;
          </p>
          <p>
            // Variables can be manually set to `undefined` like so
            var x2 = undefined;
          </p>
          <p>
            // The keyword `const` means constant, hence the variable cannot be reassigned
            // as the value is `constant`.

        Important tools have evolved with the language. <br>
        <ul>
          <li> Every major web browser has built-in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger. </li>
          <li> Static program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set
            of
            standards and guidelines. </li>
          <li> Some browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as
            benchmark.js and jsbench. </li>
          <li> Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code. </li>
